## Workload Authenticator for Windows

Workload Authenticator for Windows (WWAuth) lets Windows applications authenticate to Google Cloud using their 
Active Directory Kerberos credentials. Using WWAuth is an alternative to using service account keys
and doesn't require you to manage and store any secrets or keys.
